======

This is Build It Bigger project of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.
The purpose of this project was to built an app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoint.

The finished app consists of 4 modules:

1. A Java library that provides jokes
2. A Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes
3. An Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes
4. An Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display. Paid and Free (with ads) flavors.
